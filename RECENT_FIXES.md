# üîß Recent Fixes - RunClub Directory v2

## Issues Fixed (January 26, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ **Fixed Text Visibility on Popular Cities Cards**

**Problem**: The "Featured Running Clubs" text was hard to read due to dark gradient overlay.

**Solution**:
- Improved gradient overlay: `from-black/70 via-black/20 to-transparent`
- Added text shadows: `drop-shadow-lg` and `drop-shadow-md`
- Increased font size for city names: `text-lg`
- Enhanced opacity for club count: `opacity-95`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 100-110)

### 2. ‚úÖ **Fixed Popular Cities Search Results**

**Problem**: Clicking on popular cities only showed 1 result instead of multiple clubs.

**Solutions**:
- **Dynamic City Counts**: Now shows actual club counts from data
- **Better Search Logic**: Improved location matching with bidirectional search
- **Data-Driven Cities**: Only shows cities that have clubs
- **Proper Pluralization**: "1 club" vs "2 clubs"

**Files Changed**:
- `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 11-38) - Dynamic city data
- `src/lib/runclubs.ts` (line 111) - Enhanced search logic

### 3. ‚úÖ **Added Debug Page**

**Purpose**: Help troubleshoot search functionality.

**Access**: Visit `/debug` to see:
- All clubs and their cities
- City counts
- Search results for specific cities

**File Added**:
- `src/app/debug/page.tsx`

## Current Data Structure

Based on fallback data, we have clubs in:
- **New York**: 2 clubs
- **Brooklyn**: 1 club  
- **Queens**: 1 club
- **Bronx**: 1 club
- **Staten Island**: 1 club

## Test Instructions

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/lab/runclub-v2
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the fixes**:
   - Visit homepage - check text visibility on city cards
   - Click on "New York" city card - should show 2 clubs
   - Click on other cities - should show 1 club each
   - Visit `/debug` to verify data

3. **Search functionality**:
   - Search by city name (e.g., "Brooklyn")
   - Search by partial city name (e.g., "York")
   - Both should return matching results

## Technical Improvements

- **Enhanced CSS**: Better text shadows and gradient overlays
- **Dynamic Data**: City counts pulled from actual data
- **Bidirectional Search**: Matches both "New York" ‚Üí "New" and "New" ‚Üí "New York"
- **Error Prevention**: Only shows cities with clubs
- **Debug Tools**: Easy troubleshooting with debug page
